  <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
  <p>
    CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
    Continuous Integration (CI) means that developers frequently push code changes to a shared repository.
    Each push automatically triggers tests and validation steps to detect errors early.
    Continuous Deployment (CD) means that once the checks pass successfully, the updated version of the application
    is automatically deployed to production.
    This process improves reliability, reduces manual work, and ensures faster and safer software delivery.
  </p>

  <h2>My Pipeline Process</h2>
  <p>
    When I push changes to the main branch on GitHub, GitHub Actions automatically runs my workflow.
    The workflow verifies that the required files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) exist.
    If everything is correct, the site files are uploaded and deployed to GitHub Pages.
    As a result, my live website is automatically updated after every successful push.
  </p>

  <h2>Why CI/CD is Important</h2>
  <p>
    CI/CD helps automate repetitive tasks, reduces human errors, and ensures consistent deployment.
    It allows developers to focus on writing code while automation handles testing and publishing.
    This is especially useful in cloud environments where fast and reliable updates are required.
